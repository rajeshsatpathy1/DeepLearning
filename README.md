# Image Classification on CIFAR-10 dataset using modified ResNet architecture

The developed Deep Neural Neural network is trained on 50,000 train images and 10,000 test images on the CIFAR-10 dataset to get an accuracy of 93.14%.
The model's layers are selected and built to avoid Vanishing/Exploding gradient problem. This is done using layers of Batch Normalization, Dropouts and ReLU activation.
The number of hidden layers is increased and the filters are widened without increasing training error using skip connections and identity mappings to improve accuracy of model
